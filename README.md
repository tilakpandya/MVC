### 5. Feasibility Study:
Operational feasibility:
This is a website that will run on every browser. The user of this website will expect to buy furniture. To make sure that the user gets a hassle free buying experience, we made efforts in simplifying the user interface. For admin, we created a panel that has easy to insert, update and delete system. No specific training is required to use this system as it is straight-forward. This system is user friendly and hence there will be no problem for the user to carry out jobs. Hence this system is operationally feasible.

#### 5.1 Technical feasibility:
This website is developed using PHP Core programming, MySQL, JavaScript programming and Ajax using jQuery & JavaScript library. As these technologies are supported by all modern browsers without any additional extensions to be installed, this is technically feasible to both develop and use.
#### 5.2 Economic Feasibility:
Organization does not require managing inventory and sales report manually on paper, so
that will help in savings. Also does not require for more salesmen to describe products to the customers to theirplace, organization just required delivery persons to deliver the products.
